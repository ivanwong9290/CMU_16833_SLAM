At a macro, the particle filter runs as follows, which can be broken down into 4 steps: <br/>

<br/>
## Part 1: Initialization <br/>
&nbsp; - 500 particles <br/>
&nbsp; - 30 equally separated rays centered about particle orientation (These rays are used to scan the environment to detect interference) <br/>
&nbsp; - Occupancy threshold = 0.35 (Any value greater than that is considered an obstacle for the robot) <br/>
## Part 2: Motion Model <br/>
The following is the odometry model used for each particle, the Î± values represent motion noises <br/>

## Part 3: Ray Casting Sensor Model <br/>
The following is the sensor model used for each particle, the z values can be conveyed as weight for different ray casting noises  <br/>

## Part 4: Resampling <br/>
Finally, the following algorithm resamples particles based on the weights assigned in the previous step <br/>
