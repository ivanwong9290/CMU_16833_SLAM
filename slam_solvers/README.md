In essence, a SLAM problem can be described as a large system of equation (Ax=b) with the unknown being x, the state. The basis of this homework is to compare different matrix factorizations for the fastest solving time in a linear system and a nonlinear system <br/>
<br/>
Below shows a sample of a solved nonlinear SLAM system <br/>
