This is a homework assignment demonstrating an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) written from scratch. <br/>
<br/>
Below is the result of the SLAM problem, with the 6 dots in the middle being landmarks, each blue star represents the estimated state from EKF, and the red circles around the blue stars represent the 2D covariance of the position.
